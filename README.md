# movie-downloader

> [!NOTE]
> This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25.
> [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
> This project currently needs linux to run; Windows support will be added when
> `bun` is ready.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run cli.ts
```

This doesn't download anything automatically yet, but helps you find the
movies/tv series and download links. Find them in `data/sources` and use your
favorite download manager, maybe a player, or a tool like `yt-dlp` to download
them.

> [!WARNING]
> I'm not sure about the legal status of this project, or the library
> @movie-web/providers. I'll take it down if I'm asked to.
