An interactive CLI movie downloader using [@movie-web](https://github.com/movie-web) providers.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25.
> [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
> This project currently needs linux to run; Windows support will be added when
> `bun` is ready.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
```

You also need to have `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` downloaded and added to path. 
This can currently download tv series found as files or as HLS streams.
